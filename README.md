# RaidRemix
Mod for RAID: World War 2.\
\
RAID REMIXED Initial Plans For Public Eyes:\
AMMO DROPS:\
 - Can be picked up as usual, but additionally: standing in (x) radius of enemy-dropped ammunition for more than (x) seconds will pick up small portions of it over time until depleted OR until manually retrieved.\
 - Solves some issues with the gunplay loop being interrupted constantly without removing system intent.\
\
ENEMY & PLAYER BALANCE:\
 - Make Flamers not so buggy!!!\
 - Improve visual and audio clarity across unit categories\
\
SYSTEMS CHANGES:\
 - Most primary weapons have a chance to penetrate some walls & other surfaces\
 - E3 HUD/UI used as reference point/iterate upon (as a setting?)\
 - Revise/update gold accrual systems.\
 - Unique save for it + MM key\
 - Remove limited downs system.  Make it D2 styled, IE: bleedout timer hitting 0 'incapacitates' players, match only ends if every player is currently downed.
